Interactive-Intelligent-System-Project

The project is about finding the matching plant for everyone.
we created a customized system that finds the perfect match between the user and plant based on several criteria or based on previous success.

This version is a prototype version.

**In order to run the code you need to upload the data file to the google colab and then run the notebook.**

The prototype contains 3 parts: preprocess, based on previous success, based on routine and location.
The code contains comments that explain in detail what each part contains.
In each part there are instructions and explanations of what needs to be done in each part and how to run it in order to get the desired result.
